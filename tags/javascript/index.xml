      <description>Welcome! Cheers! üç∑
While my roommate and I are stranded inside during this COVID-19 crises, we have been drinking more often than we probably should; and much of that consumption has been red wine. Now, we are not wine snobs, we will proudly buy all the sub $10 bottles we can find during a trip to the MLCC. But that&amp;rsquo;s not to say that we don&amp;rsquo;t enjoy finer wines or that we don&amp;rsquo;t have some pricier favorites.</description>
